## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Python 3.8+ (for ML scripts)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
\`\`\`bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd churn-prediction-dashboard
\`\`\`

2. **Install dependencies**
\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

3. **Run the development server**
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

4. **Open your browser**
Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Using the Dashboard

1. **Upload Data**: Drag and drop your CSV file or click to select
2. **Generate Predictions**: Click "Generate Predictions" to process your data
3. **View Results**: Explore the interactive charts and tables
4. **Download Results**: Export predictions as CSV file

## 📈 Data Format

Your CSV file should include customer features such as:
- `customer_id`: Unique identifier
- `tenure`: Length of service (months)
- `monthly_charges`: Monthly billing amount
- `total_charges`: Total amount charged
- `contract`: Contract type
- `payment_method`: Payment method
- `internet_service`: Internet service type
- Additional demographic and service features

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### POST /api/predict
Upload CSV file and receive churn predictions
- **Input**: FormData with CSV file
- **Output**: JSON with predictions and metrics

### POST /api/train
Train a new model with uploaded training data
- **Input**: FormData with training CSV
- **Output**: JSON with training results and metrics

## 🚀 Deployment

This application is designed for deployment on Vercel:

1. **Connect to Vercel**
\`\`\`bash
vercel --prod
\`\`\`

2. **Environment Variables**
No additional environment variables required for basic functionality.

## 📊 Model Approach

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Missing Value Handling**: Median imputation for numerical, mode for categorical
2. **Feature Encoding**: Label encoding for categorical variables
3. **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler for numerical features
4. **Feature Engineering**: Derived features from existing data

### Model Training
1. **Algorithm Selection**: Compared Random Forest vs Logistic Regression
2. **Optimization**: Grid search for hyperparameter tuning
3. **Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation
4. **Metric Focus**: Optimized for AUC-ROC score

### Prediction Pipeline
1. **Data Validation**: Input format checking
2. **Preprocessing**: Same pipeline as training
3. **Inference**: Probability scores and binary predictions
4. **Post-processing**: Risk categorization and ranking

## 🎨 Visualizations

- **Distribution Plot**: Histogram of churn probabilities
- **Pie Chart**: Churn vs retain segmentation with adjustable threshold
- **Risk Table**: Top customers ranked by churn probability
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Model performance indicators
- **Feature Importance**: Most predictive features
